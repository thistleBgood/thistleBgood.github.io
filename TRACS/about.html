            <h3>Step 1 - Import File</h3>
            <p>Upload the file you want to annotate by clicking on the "Import" button and navigating to the location of your file. TRACS will automatically add some <em>range</em> annotations to the file before displaying it on screen.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 2 - Range annotations</h3>
            <p>TRACS assumes that every line is an individual <em>statement</em>. Although this is the case most of the time, sometimes there are more than one per line, and sometimes they span across multiple lines. <span class="unimplemented">The contextual menu will allow you to make changes as appropriate.</span></p>
            <p>Once the main structure of the statements is in place, you can begin to add <em>expression</em> ranges to the code. To do this, just highlight the code and click "Annotate". You can nest both <em>statements</em> and <em>expressions</em> inside one another. <span class="unimplemented">If you make a mistake, you can also switch which type of range it is by clicking the contextual menu.</span></p>

            <h3><span class="unimplemented">Step 3 - Static Control Flow</span></h3>
            <p>To add <em>static control flow arrows</em>, click and drag from one <em>range</em> to another. To add <em>decision points</em>, click and drag from a <em>range</em> that already has an <em>arrow</em> coming from it.</p>
            
            <h3><span class="unimplemented">Step 4 - Dynamic Control Flow</span></h3>
            <p>The <em>dynamic control flow</em> layer consists of three parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <em>trace table</em> in the top middle section;</li>
                <li>An <em>evaluator</em> in the bottom middle section;</li>
                <li>And a <em>files</em> section in the right hand section.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each section starts out empty. <em>Files</em> starts out with three default file locations: <b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b> and <b>stderr</b>. If you don't need the files, or you want to add more, you can do this through the contextual menu.</p>
            <p>There is also a <em>step counter</em>, which allows you to move forwards or backwards through the execution of the program.</p>
            <p>To add an entry to any of the three sections, click on the <span class="plus">+</span> button. Fill in the value and it will automatically be marked with the current <em>step</em>. To modify a previously entered value, just click on the pop up contextual menu.</p>
            <p>You can also have multiple <em>dynamic control flow</em> layers, each with different values and <em>files</em>.</p>
